# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — initial testable release

- Added one area-aware window recommendation sensor (`open`, `close`, `idle`, `blocked`) with window IDs, reasons, and diagnostics.
- Added multi-step Home Assistant UI setup for areas, compatible outdoor air sensors, weather and warning entities, optional delivery, and configurable thresholds.
- Added event-driven re-evaluation and cautious policies for missing outdoor data, rain, storms, severe weather warnings and opened windows.
- Added optional Announcement Hub or direct Home Assistant notify/TTS delivery, including five translation languages and per-action language overrides.
- Added HACS metadata, locally bundled Home Assistant branding, validation workflows and sample diagrams.

**Validation:** Pure Python tests and static checks pass locally; Home Assistant, HACS and Hassfest live validation are still required.
